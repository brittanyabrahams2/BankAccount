# BankAccount
I have created a Bank Console Application with some missing checkpoints described below.Overrall the core classes (loan/checkingaccount/business account/termdeposit) work as they should.

Missing Checkpoints:
- does not check for multiple loans
- does not store ID for each deposit/withdraw so the balance is not updating for each account
